## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Eliahhango/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(This project uses a direct CDN importmap setup for development, so no `npm install` is needed for local viewing. Simply open `index.html` in a live server.)*

### Running Locally

Since this project uses ES modules and an importmap, you can run it with any local web server. A popular choice is the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code.

1.  Open the project folder in VS Code.
2.  Right-click on `index.html`.
3.  Select "Open with Live Server".

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is a static site and can be deployed to any static hosting service. Here are instructions for a few popular platforms.

**Note:** For a production deployment, you would typically use a build tool like Vite or Create React App to bundle your TypeScript and React code into optimized static files. The following instructions assume a build process that outputs to a `dist` or `build` folder.

### Vercel (Recommended)

1.  Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  Sign up or log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
3.  Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
4.  Import the forked repository from GitHub.
5.  Vercel will automatically detect that it's a React project and configure the build settings for you.
6.  Click **Deploy**. Your site will be live in minutes!

### Netlify

1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Sign up or log in to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
3.  Click "Add new site" -> "Import an existing project".
4.  Connect to your Git provider (e.g., GitHub) and select the forked repository.
5.  Netlify will likely auto-detect the settings. If not, configure as follows:
    -   **Build command:** `npm run build` (or your build script)
    -   **Publish directory:** `dist` (or your output directory)
6.  Click **Deploy site**.

### Render

1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Sign up or log in to [Render](https://render.com/).
3.  Click "New +" -> "Static Site".
4.  Connect your GitHub account and select the forked repository.
5.  Configure the settings:
    -   **Build command:** `npm run build`
    -   **Publish directory:** `./dist`
6.  Click **Create Static Site**.

### Heroku

While Heroku is primarily for backend applications, you can deploy a static site using a buildpack.

1.  Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
2.  Log in to Heroku: `heroku login`.
3.  Create a new Heroku app: `heroku create your-app-name`.
4.  Set the static buildpack for your app:
    ```sh
    heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static.git
    ```
5.  Create a file named `static.json` in the root of your project with the following content (assuming a `build` output folder):
    ```json
    {
      "root": "build/",
      "routes": {
        "/**": "index.html"
      }
    }
    ```
6.  Commit the `static.json` file and push to Heroku:
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add static.json for Heroku deployment"
    git push heroku main
    ```
