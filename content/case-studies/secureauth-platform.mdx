## Problem
Enterprises needed stronger login security with minimal friction across web and mobile apps.

## Solution
I built a modular MFA platform (TOTP, SMS, backup codes) with RBAC admin, rate‑limiting, audit logs, and alerts.

## Impact
- 0 critical auth incidents after rollout
- 35% reduction in support tickets for account lockouts
- Flexible integrations through REST and webhooks
